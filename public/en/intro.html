                Vadim Bryskin is one of the pioneers of visual holography, he presents a series of fine and artistic
                holograms that demonstrate the high level of achievements of the Russian school of holography.
            </p>
            <p>
                The presented holograms were made from the beginning of the 1980s of the last century and show the
                stages of development of visual holography. If at the beginning of its development these were mainly
                holograms-copies of museum exhibits, then later holograms for advertising, holograms-design for interior
                decoration and, finally, holographic portrait appeared.
            </p>
            <p>
                Vadim Bryskin was born in 1950 in St. Petersburg. After graduation from the Leningrad Electrotechnical
                Institute (LETI). IN AND. Ulyanov-Lenin since 1973 worked in the State Optical Institute. SI Vavilov
                (GOI) under the guidance of Yu.N. Denisyuk - the author of three-dimensional reflective holography,
                academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1990, Vadim Bryskin organized powerful holographic production at the Leningrad Art Glass Factory, and
                in 1992 he opened the world's first holographic studio, working for a man from the street, where
                everyone could order his holographic portrait. Atelier was located on the main street of St. Petersburg
                - Nevsky Prospekt. According to the well-known experts - holographs of the world, portraits made in this
                studio - ateliers were the best in the world in quality.
            </p>
            <p>
                The joint work of Vadim Bryskin and the artist Alexander Prostev from the late 80's fruitfully affected
                the development of a new direction in art - artistic holography. Holograms made by them, were
                successfully acquired by connoisseurs of art in different countries of the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the years, many exhibitions around the world took place, where holograms produced by a team of
                specialists led by Vadim Bryskin were displayed. And everywhere they caused admiration from the
                audience. Their high quality constantly confirmed the priority of the Russian school of holography,
                created by an outstanding scientist - Yu.N. Denisyuk.
            </p>
            <p>
                The work of Vadim Bryskin with the famous museums of St. Petersburg - the Hermitage, the Kunstkamera of
                Peter I, the Museum of Ethnography, etc., has widely demonstrated the possibilities of using holography
                in the museum business.
            </p>
            <p>
                Art holography opens new possibilities in interior design. Using a holographic image in advertising
                enhances the effect of perception by the viewer. Holographic portrait can not be underestimated. Today
                it is a premise in the future of your image.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, despite the fact that holography as a science has been developing for over 35 years, many
                people in the world know little about it.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    A series of holograms is proposed for the organization of the exhibition in order to acquaint
                    viewers with the history of the development of visual holography, the principles of the holographic
                    method, the possibilities of using holography.
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Perhaps, one of the viewers will see unique exhibits from the collections of famous museums of the world
                for the first time, and someone will certainly want to leave a memory in the form of a holographic image
                about themselves or about people close to them, animals.
